### Velocity Smoother

Champ Quadruped Robot's velocity smoother node. This is a forked version of [yocs_velocity_smooter](https://github.com/yujinrobot/yujin_ocs).

The software has been modified to add support velocity smoothing in the y axis.

The recent version was fully re-written to support ROS 2 Humble.
